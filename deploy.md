## Deployment

* Releases are tagged and finalized on mondays during/after dev meeting 14.30 GMT+1
* Deploy to production happens every Tuesday at 13:00-16:00 UTC
* A release should be created to a deploy to track the specific change pushed out
* Deploys should be done with scripts and avoid manual intervention or work
* Out of band deploys should only happen for critical outages or major security holes
* Anyone should be able to deploy
* Our goal is continuous deployment and moving the deploys to monday as they get leaner
