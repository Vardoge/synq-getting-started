# Guidelines for issue-tracker

### Tags

__All issues on github _should_ have one of the following labels describing the type__

* Feature
* Task
* Improvement
* Bug
* Discussion

_Note: Issues can have other tags as well these are just the standard categories_

## Scheduling

* Issues should now be scheduled each monday into the current weekly milestone.
* The first monday of the month goes through the monthly review issues.
* Developers are responsible for moving issues into the monthly review session, this means that you have to champion your features.
* Tech-lead is responsible for issues that non-developers wants championed.
* Issues can be inserted quite freely into the weekly review, if someone feels that it is important that we get to an issue.
* If an issue is broken down into smaller issues, those can be scheduled directly into the same week as parent issues was in and/or weekly/monthly review.

### Milestones

* Monthly review - Issues in this milestone will be reviewed on the first monday of every month.
* Weekly review - Issues in this milestone will be reviewed every monday.
* Weekly Milestone - Issues that have been scheduled for a specific week.
* Uncertain - Issues that we are not sure about when or if we will do. Might need more discussion or be out of scope. (devs responsible for escalating, tech-lead responsible for cleaning up)
