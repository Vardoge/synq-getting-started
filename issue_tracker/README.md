## Issue Lifecycle

We use GitHub issues and ZenHub to manage our work.  Here's our major [board](https://github.com/SYNQfm/obaku#boards?repos=83064032,79477666,80748537,81571134,79564980,81447813,84829819,79788970,81179259) where you can see all of our issues across all of development repos.  Here's a helpful [guide](guidelines.md) for creating issues.

### Organization

* Epics
* Milestones
* Issues

### Board Review

* Backlog
* Planning/Design
* In Progress
* Review/QA
* Closed

### Milestones

* Major Milestone review - Issues in this milestone will be reviewed on the first monday of every month.
* Weekly review - Issues in this milestone will be reviewed every monday.
* Weekly Milestone - Issues that have been scheduled for a specific week.
* Pending - Issues that we are not sure about when or if we will do. Might need more discussion or be out of scope. (devs responsible for escalating, tech-lead responsible for cleaning up)

### Scheduling

* Issues should now be scheduled each monday into the current weekly milestone.
* The first monday of the month goes through the monthly review issues.
* Developers are responsible for moving issues into the monthly review session, this means that you have to champion your features.
* Tech-lead is responsible for issues that non-developers wants championed.
* Issues can be inserted quite freely into the weekly review, if someone feels that it is important that we get to an issue.
* If an issue is broken down into smaller issues, those can be scheduled directly into the same week as parent issues was in and/or weekly/monthly review.
