# Guidelines for Issue Tracking

Anyone in the organization can create issues (biz/sales/r&d/customer success), but they need to follow these guidelines

### Tag it

__All issues on github _should_ have one of the following labels describing the type__

* Feature
* Task
* Improvement
* Bug
* Discussion

_Note: Issues can have other tags as well these are just the standard categories_

### Give it your best guess

Issues should have an "Estimate", which is the hours/points you think this will take.  This is just an estimate, and there might be an initial stab that gets updated to reflect the real work required

### Put it in the right place

It is up to you to decide what the relative priority is of a specific issue.  Issues will typically fall into 4 categories

* Critical - production down issue that requires immediate attention, and requires patching
* Relevant/Required - This should be done in the current week or current milestone, is most likely highly reflective of what needs to be done to accomplish our epics
* Normal - This should be done over the course of one or two milestones
* TODO - This would be a nice to have and should be eventually done, more like tracking high level features

Based on those priorities, you will place the issues in the follow states
