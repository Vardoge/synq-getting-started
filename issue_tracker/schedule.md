### Scheduling

* Issues should now be scheduled each monday into the current week.  Also determine if we're on track for the current Milestone and what has to be adjusted
* The first monday of the month go through next milestone to see if there's clarification, epic creation, any themes that emerge
* The first Monday of each Quarter (Jan/April/July/Oct), review all issues in the backlog and determine if some should be closed or scheduled for next milestone review
* Developers are responsible for moving issues into the monthly review session, this means that you have to champion your features.
* Tech-lead is responsible for issues that non-developers wants championed.
* Issues can be inserted quite freely into `Pending Schedule`, if someone feels that it is important that we get to an issue.
* If an issue is broken down into smaller issues, those can be scheduled directly into the same week as parent issues was in and/or weekly/monthly review.
